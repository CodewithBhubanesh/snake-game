In the Snake Game, players navigate a pixelated snake around the screen using directional controls (up, down, left, right). Each time the snake eats a food item, it grows longer, making movement increasingly difficult. The objective is to survive as long as possible while achieving the highest score. The snake must avoid running into the edges of the screen (or boundaries) and must not collide with itself. As the snake gets longer, players must strategize to manage space and movements carefully. The game is known for its simple graphics, intuitive gameplay, and nostalgic value, having been a staple on early mobile phones and classic computers.
